# Project Requirement Document (PRD) Instructions

## Structure for Solo Development

- **Project Overview**: Brief description of what's being built and why
- **Personal Goals**: What you want to achieve and learn from this project
- **Core Features**: Prioritized list of functionality to implement
- **Technical Approach**: Stack, architecture, and implementation strategy

## Requirements Format

- Keep requirements simple and flexible
- Use a 3-tier priority system:
  - Essential
  - Important
  - Nice-to-have
- Use a 10-tier difficulty system:
  - 0: Very easy to implement
  - 10: Very hard to implement
- Focus on Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first
- Document assumptions to revisit later
- Create lightweight user stories: "As a user, I want to ___ so that ___"
- Set small, achievable milestones to maintain momentum

## Documentation Guidelines

- Use Markdown files for documentation
- Document external APIs or services to integrate
- Create rough sketches or wireframes for UI elements
- Track dependencies between features
- Note potential technical challenges and alternative approaches
- Keep a separate "future ideas" section to avoid scope creep
- Balance technical challenges with quick wins to maintain motivation
